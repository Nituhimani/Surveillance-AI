# Surveillance-AI
For SIH 2025

Problem
Today, NSG is operating a myriad of Surveillance Systems ranging from medium range surveillance drones to small two wheel robots and body cams. The vast amount of video data available to an ICP can become unmanageable to be analysed physically and in the bargain important information can be overlooked. There is currently no automated tool/software for carrying out this analysis without human interference.

Description
AI/ML-Powered Video Analysis
AI/ML-powered video analysis automates the process of extracting meaningful insights from video footage, enabling machines to interpret complex visual data, identify patterns, and track movement with minimal human intervention. This technology utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyse video content, identify objects and understand actions or events occurring within the video. The benefits which will accrue are given as under:

AI systems can analyse video feeds from surveillance cameras, drones, and other sources in real-time, identifying unusual behaviour or potential threats that might be missed by human analysts.
AI can be trained to recognize specific objects (weapons, explosives, etc.) and activities (loitering, suspicious movements, etc.) associated with terrorist activities, triggering alerts when detected.
Facial recognition technology can be used to identify individuals of interest, compare them against watchlists, and track their movements.


Proposed Software Solution
It is proposed that a software be designed which can take inputs from any surveillance devices, analyse and categorise the information based on the user requirement. This type of software will ensure that even legacy systems can be utilised without the need to upgrade them. The system should have the following capabilities:

Video Input: Video data will be collected from various sources, such as surveillance cameras, body cams or drones already existing and being used in the NSG. The system should be capable of receiving a wide variety of inputs in different formats.
Feature Extraction: Computer vision algorithms will extract relevant features from the video frames, such as objects, patterns or activities. The system should be capable of understanding the user requirement, and should be programmable in an easy manner.
Model Training: These extracted features will be fed into AI models (often neural networks) that have been trained on large datasets of labelled video data, which will be done based on NSG's requirement.
Analysis and interpretation: The trained AI models will analyse the video in real time or from archived footage, Identifying objects, actions and events.
Output: The system will generate various outputs, such as alerts, reports, heatmaps or raw data, depending on the application and user requirement.
